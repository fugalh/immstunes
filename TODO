Use IMMS playlist if it exists, else Music playlist
    - update caching: cache (persistent_ID, location or nil) pairs (hash
      to yaml)
        - pl.tracks.persistent_ID.get is much faster than pl.tracks.get not to
          mention pl.tracks.location.get which doesn't even work (because of
          url tracks) without iterating through and rescuing (which is even
          slower)
        - when location is nil send the persistent_ID to imms, which will
          probably call it [Unknown]
        
be more careful about sending commands only if @tunes.is_running? and make the
them nonblocking?

It'd sure be nice to get events from iTunes instead of polling. Is this
possible? We'd need next song notification with some indication as to whether
the previous song was skipped, and I think that's it.

Maybe an option to adjust iTunes ratings to match IMMS ratings.
