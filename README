immsTunes is a daemon that marries iTunes and IMMS[1] on OS X.

Requires Ruby, rb-appscript[2], IMMS and iTunes. You probably already have Ruby
and iTunes.

To build IMMS, download and extract the 3.1.0-rc4 tarball, then apply the
imms-3.1.0-rc4.diff patch included with immsTunes, then see README.osx.

Install with

    sudo make install

Run it in the background, e.g. using screen:

    screen immsTunes -v

As long as immsTunes is running, it will learn from your listening habits. If
you want it to control your playlist, put iTunes in Party Shuffle and set
"Display Upcoming Tracks" to 0 (if you set it to any other value, Party Shuffle
will work as it always did, without consulting IMMS).

immsTunes accepts -q for quiet operation (warnings and errors only), -v for
verbose operation (echo most commands to/from the server) and -d for debug
(echo everything to/from server).

growl_imms is a simple daemon that watches your IMMS log and growls the
before/after ratings. It's always interesting to see how the ratings are
changing, especially when you first start using IMMS.
