immsTunes is a daemon that marries iTunes and IMMS[1] on OS X.

Requires Ruby, rb-appscript[2], IMMS and iTunes. You probably already have Ruby
and iTunes.

Building IMMS on OS X is presently painful. I document the process on my blog[3]
(ignore all the rambling about Audacious). Hopefully this will soon be remedied.

Run it in the background, e.g.

    screen ./immsTunes.rb -v

As long as immsTunes is running, it will learn from your listening habits. If
you want it to control your playlist, put iTunes in Party Shuffle and set the
upcoming tracks to 0 (if you have upcoming tracks to any other value, Party
Shuffle will work as it always did, without consulting IMMS).

Distributed under the same license as Ruby.
