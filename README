immsTunes is a daemon that marries iTunes and IMMS[1] on OS X.

Requires Ruby, rb-appscript[2], IMMS and iTunes. You probably already have Ruby
and iTunes.

To build IMMS, download and extract the 3.1.0-rc4 tarball, then apply the
imms-3.1.0-rc4.diff patch included with immsTunes, then see README.osx.

Install with

    sudo make install

Run it in the background, e.g. using screen:

    screen immsTunes -v

As long as immsTunes is running, it will learn from your listening habits. If
you want it to control your playlist, put iTunes in Party Shuffle and set
"Display Upcoming Tracks" to 0 (if you set it to any other value, Party Shuffle
will work as it always did, without consulting IMMS).

immsTunes will use the IMMS playlist as its master playlist, if it exists,
otherwise your local Music playlist. If you keep most of your music in a large
iPod, you would want to add it to the IMMS playlist. It's easy to set up a
live-updating smart playlist with the music you want. For best results, add
them as files on the filesystem (using e.g. FUSEPod[4]) so that immsd can find
them and analyze them. If you just drag them from the iTunes source, immsd
won't be able to analyze the files for tags or audio content.

immsTunes accepts -q for quiet operation (warnings and errors only), -v for
verbose, and -d for debug messages.

growl_imms is a simple daemon that watches your IMMS log and growls the
before/after ratings. It's always interesting to see how the ratings are
changing, especially when you first start using IMMS.

    growl_imms -v &

It appears that poking iTunes with AppleScript as we do can cause it to crash
if you have crossfading enabled.
